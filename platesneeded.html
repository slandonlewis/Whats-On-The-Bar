    <h1>What Weights Do I Need?</h1>
    <h3>So you're following a training program that tells you what weight you need to use for any given set. But how do you figure out what plates are necessary?
        Not a problem! Just type in the weight you need loaded, select what barbell you are using, choose your unit of measurement (LBS or KGS), and we will tell you
        the minimum amount of plates you need to load on the bar!
